# Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP
“Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?”

# Genetic Algorithm
I used this algorithm to compare the results with [Simulated Annealing!](https://github.com/FawazQutami/Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Simulated-Annealing) results.

# Code written in Python
This code is meant to be used as either a research tool or a study guide for anyone interested in learning about Genetic Algorithm.
